# REST Countries API with color theme switcher

This is a stab at the Frontend Mentor challenge [**REST Countries API with color
theme switcher**](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).

My own purpose of doing this challege was to get my feet wet with
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

I've purposly **not** created this implementation as close to the Frontend
Mentor original as possible, since I think that that design has a lot of flaws.
